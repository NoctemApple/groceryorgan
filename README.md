Oh Hi! This is my attempt at a project thats been in my head for years, 
it is due alot of changes as I am learning as I go and getting experience on Django and the like.

Objectives:
1) store previous grocery lists
2) based on the previous list it will automatically organize the new list according to the previous order the grocery list was done in
3) this will continue on and on
4) maybe it works.
