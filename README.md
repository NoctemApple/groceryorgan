# Oh Hi! 
This is my attempt at a project thats been in my head for years, 
it is due alot of changes as I am learning as I go and getting experience on Django and the like.

## How to run:
python manage.py runserver

## Objectives:
1) Store previous grocery lists in a json file.
2) Based on the previous list it will automatically organize the new list according to the previous order the grocery list was done in.
3) Be useable anywhere and useable on mobile.

## To do list:
1) Improve UI.
2) Make sorting better.
3) Make the UI actually good.
4) Test and improve mobile experience.
